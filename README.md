# Show me what you got
## Data Science Numpy Project

[Link to github page](https://github.com/SarahDC7/Show_me_what_you_got)

This repository is the result of an assignment to practice the **Numpy package** for the course "Data Scientist" taught at Syntra AB.

The assignment entails doing a number of manipulations with a chosen image. The manipulations that are available in this repository are:
- **make square**: the name says what it does
- **tile floor**: choose the number of times you want to repeat your image in length and width to make a grid
- **flip tiles**: flip the tiles in the grid according to input matrix
- **colorful frame**: your image framed with small colored versions of the same image, you can choose the scale
- **testbeeld**: it's... art, you'll have to look at the example
- **design your flag**: choose 3 colors from a list of 6 and design your flag
- **flag - zombie grid**: speaking of art... combining the flag with a reverse color cut-out of your image

The repository consists of a **data/input folder** that contains an *example .png file* to use when testing the written code,
and a **notebooks folder** that contains *3 notebooks and a .yml file* to recreate the virtual environment to run the code.


### showme.yml

Using this file you can create the environment I worked in to write this code.

### Run_fun_examples
You can run this notebook without having to do anything. It gives you an overview of all the functions available and what they do.
Just sit back and relax. I'll show you what I got.

### Show_me_fun_examples
This notebook expects some interaction. User input will be asked, so you can play around with the functions.

### Show_me_buildup
This notebook gives you an insight in my thought patterns to build these fun(ctions). Open at your own risk :)
It shows all the code that I've written for this project.
